     -PROS
       -They are faster 
     -CONS
       -They are difficult to debug and are not cross-platform
 -   Interpreted Language  works when our program is immediately sent to the server where every line of code is checked separately and once every line is checked the response is sent back to the user
     -PROS
       -They are cross-platform
       -They are easy to debug
     -CONS
       -They work more slowly
